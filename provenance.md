Following the recent publication of the PROV standard for provenance on the Web this Morgan & Claypool Synthesis lecture is a hands-on introduction to PROV aimed at Web and linked data professionals. By means of recipes, illustrations, this site, and tools, it guides practitioners through a variety of issues related to provenance: how to generate provenance, publish it on the Web, make it discoverable, and how to utilize it. Equipped with this knowledge, practitioners will be in a position to develop novel applications that can bring openness, trust, and accountability.
